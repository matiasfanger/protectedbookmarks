# ProtectedBookmarks

First project on github, but not the first done. You may wonder why im making this and what utility i give to it. 

I have too many links saved in notepads, which I can't save in bookmarks for some reasons and its imposible to open one by one. 

This is console based. This program make my life a little bit easier, and i hope it does for you.
